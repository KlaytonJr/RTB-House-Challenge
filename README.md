## RTB House - Web Developer Challenge

This is my resolve of the challenge about the Web Developer Position.

Each task resolution was build in the folder "resolve" and all of them have 3 files, index.html, style.css and script.js.

I used GSAP at the first task, and the another ones I prefered use pure JavaScript and CSS, but it's possible to use GSAP or Anime.js for anothers tasks, like to build the carrousel and build the motion design.
